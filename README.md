# Summary of Data
# Question #4 - Is there a relationship between BMI and the number of children?

I have prepared three graphs. The first graph illustrates the relationship between BMI and the number of children in both men and women. The second graph explores the same relationship but focuses exclusively on women, while the third graph examines the relationship in men.

Contrary to the initial hypothesis, which suggested a potential correlation between BMI and the number of children, the data presented in the three graphs does not indicate a direct correlation. Therefore, we explored an alternative approach. The subsequent three graphs, which average and switch the variables, reinforce the conclusion that, from various perspectives, BMI does not appear to correlate with the number of children that individuals have.
