Objective:
Predict medical costs for over 1300 individuals, based on attributes such as age, gender, BMI, how many children they have, if there are any smoker or not.

Identify if there are any relationships on the above factors with the insurance cost and geographic regions.

We have prepared graphs, scatter plots and pie charts to analyze the insurance dataset. The first graph illustrates the relationship between BMI and the number of children in both men and women. The second graph explores the same relationship but focuses exclusively on women, while the third graph examines the relationship in men. Scatter plots have been divided by region to see if region has any affect to cost with respect to age. Smokers analysis is divided on Age, gender and # of smokers.

Analysis on BMI, Gender and Children:
Contrary to the initial hypothesis, which suggested a potential correlation between BMI and the number of children, the data presented in the three graphs does not indicate a direct correlation. Therefore, we explored an alternative approach. The subsequent three graphs, which average and switch the variables, reinforce the conclusion that, from various perspectives, BMI does not appear to correlate with the number of children that individuals have.

Analysis on Insurance Cost, Age by region:
From the scatter plots of age vs cost per region, it is noticeable how far they are from the linear regression lines so it can be said that there is little to no correlation between age and cost no matter what region an individual is.


Analysis on Smokers:
From the Bar & pie charts of smokers, it is noticeable that 20.5% of the population are smokers and mostly in the age group of 18 and 19 years.
